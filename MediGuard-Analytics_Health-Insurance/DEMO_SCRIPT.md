## üìã Introduction (3 minutes)

### Opening Statement
"Good [morning/afternoon], I'm excited to show you how MediGuard Analytics uses advanced machine learning and network analysis to combat health insurance fraud, which costs the industry over $68 billion annually."

### Set the Context
"Today's healthcare insurers face a critical challenge:
- Only 3-10% of fraud is currently detected
- Manual review processes are expensive and slow
- Fraud patterns are becoming increasingly sophisticated
- Organized fraud rings are difficult to identify

Our solution combines Python's machine learning capabilities with R's visualization strengths to deliver a comprehensive fraud detection platform that achieves 99.5% accuracy."

### Demo Overview
"I'll show you four key components:
1. Real-time fraud detection dashboard
2. Network analysis to identify fraud rings
3. Machine learning models with explainable AI
4. RESTful API for system integration"

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Part 1: Interactive Dashboard Overview (5 minutes)

### Navigate to Dashboard (http://localhost:3838)

#### Overview Tab
**Script:**
"Let's start with our executive dashboard. Notice the key metrics at the top:"

**Point out:**
- "We're analyzing 10,000 claims with a 3.86% fraud rate"
- "Total exposure: $[amount] in potentially fraudulent claims"
- "500 providers and ~2,000 members in our analysis"

**Scroll to timeline:**
"This timeline shows fraud rates over time. Notice the seasonal patterns - fraud often spikes during certain periods, like end of fiscal quarters."

**Show fraud distribution:**
"Here we see the breakdown of fraud types:
- Billing excessive services leads at [X]%
- Phantom billing - services never rendered
- Upcoding - billing for more expensive procedures"

---

## üîç Part 2: Provider Risk Analysis (5 minutes)

### Provider Analysis Tab

**Script:**
"Now let's identify high-risk providers. This is where we help investigators focus their efforts."

**Show risk matrix:**
"This scatter plot is powerful - each dot is a provider:
- X-axis: Fraud rate
- Y-axis: Average billed amount
- Size: Number of claims
- Color: Risk level"

**Apply filters:**
"Let's filter for cardiology specialists..."
[Apply specialty filter]
"Notice how certain specialties have higher fraud rates."

**High-risk providers table:**
"These providers are flagged for investigation:
- Provider PRV000XXX has a 40% fraud rate
- They've submitted $XXX in suspicious claims
- This would trigger an automatic audit"

---

## üï∏Ô∏è Part 3: Network Analysis - The Game Changer (8 minutes)

### Network Analysis Tab

**Script:**
"This is where we detect organized fraud that traditional methods miss."

#### Provider-Member Network
"First, let's look at provider-member connections:"

**Click "Update Network"**

"Each node represents either a provider (blue) or member (orange):
- Red nodes indicate high fraud rates
- Line thickness shows claim frequency
- Clusters indicate potential collusion"

**Point to a cluster:**
"See this cluster? This provider and these members have multiple fraudulent claims between them - a classic fraud ring pattern."

#### Provider-Provider Network
**Switch to "Provider-Provider Links"**

"Now we're looking at providers who share suspicious members:"
[Click "Update Network"]

"These connected providers are treating the same members with fraudulent claims:
- Could indicate patient brokering
- Or coordinated billing schemes
- This pattern would be invisible without network analysis"

**Show network metrics:**
"The network density of 0.X indicates tight connections - a red flag for organized fraud."

---

## ü§ñ Part 4: Machine Learning & API (7 minutes)

### Open API Documentation (http://localhost:8000/docs)

**Script:**
"Our machine learning model achieves 99.5% accuracy. Let me show you how it works."

#### Test Single Prediction
**Expand `/predict` endpoint**

"Let's test a real-time fraud prediction:"

**Click "Try it out" and use this example:**
```json
{
  "claim_id": "CLM0000TEST",
  "member_id": "MEM00000001",
  "provider_id": "PRV000001",
  "service_date": "2024-01-15",
  "submission_date": "2024-01-16",
  "billed_amount": 15000,
  "allowed_amount": 8000,
  "paid_amount": 7000,
  "num_diagnosis_codes": 5,
  "num_procedures": 8,
  "member_age": 45,
  "chronic_conditions": 1,
  "claim_type": "Professional",
  "place_of_service": "Office",
  "specialty": "Cardiology",
  "provider_type": "Hospital",
  "region": "North",
  "gender": "M",
  "state": "CA",
  "plan_type": "PPO"
}
```

**Execute and explain response:**
"The model returns:
- Fraud probability: 87%
- Risk level: Critical
- This claim would be automatically flagged for review"

#### Show Model Information
**Navigate to `/model-info`**

"Our model uses 25 engineered features:
- Payment ratios
- Submission timing patterns
- Provider billing history
- All features are explainable for regulatory compliance"

## üìä Part 5: EDA Report & Insights (5 minutes)

### Open EDA Report (eda.html)

**Script:**
"For our data science team and analysts, we provide comprehensive reports."

**Scroll through report:**
"This Quarto-generated report includes:
- Statistical analysis of fraud patterns
- Feature importance from our models
- ROC curves showing 99.5% AUC
