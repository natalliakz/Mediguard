# MediGuard Analytics Demo Guide - For Posit Employees

## Executive Summary

This demo showcases a comprehensive health insurance fraud detection system that combines Python machine learning with R visualization, demonstrating the power of Posit's multi-language platform. The system identifies fraudulent claims with 99.5% accuracy while providing interactive dashboards and REST APIs for integration.

## Industry Context

### Health Insurance Fraud Challenge
- **Annual Impact**: Health insurance fraud costs the US healthcare system $68-230 billion annually
- **Detection Challenge**: Only 3-10% of fraud is typically detected
- **Common Fraud Types**:
  - Billing for services not rendered (phantom billing)
  - Upcoding (billing for more expensive services)
  - Unbundling (billing separately for bundled services)
  - Duplicate claims
  - Identity theft

### Business Value Proposition
- **ROI**: Every $1 spent on fraud detection returns $4-10 in savings
- **Efficiency**: Automated detection reduces manual review by 70%
- **Accuracy**: ML models outperform rule-based systems by 40-60%
- **Speed**: Real-time detection prevents payment before investigation

## Data Context

### Synthetic Dataset Overview
The demo uses 10,000 synthetic health insurance claims with:
- **Members**: ~2,000 unique members with demographics and plan information
- **Providers**: 500 healthcare providers across specialties
- **Fraud Rate**: ~3-5% (realistic industry rate)
- **Time Period**: 2 years of claims data

### Key Data Elements
- **Claims Data**: Service dates, amounts (billed/allowed/paid), procedures, diagnoses
- **Provider Data**: Specialty, location, practice type, billing patterns
- **Member Data**: Age, gender, state, plan type, chronic conditions
- **Fraud Indicators**: Quick submission, excessive billing, unusual patterns

## Demo Components

### 1. Python Components
- **Data Generation** (`data/generate_data.py`): Creates realistic synthetic claims
- **ML Pipeline** (`ml/train_model.py`): Trains Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression
- **Model Utilities** (`ml/model_utils.py`): Fraud detection wrapper, metrics calculation
- **REST API** (`api.py`): FastAPI endpoints for predictions and analytics

### 2. R Components
- **Shiny Dashboard** (`app.R`): Interactive fraud monitoring and analysis
- **Brand Theming**: Uses bslib with custom brand colors

### 3. Reporting
- **Quarto Report** (`eda.qmd`): Comprehensive fraud analysis with ML insights
